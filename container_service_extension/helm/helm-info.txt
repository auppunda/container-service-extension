Why use Helm?
Helm makes it easy to download kubernetes applications that are regularly used.

Integration points
-rudder 
	- rudder is the RESTful API Proxy for Helm, which will allow easy integration as long as Rudder is installed on the Kubernetes cluster
	- to launch in kubernetes use  kubectl create -f kube/manifest.yaml
	- still missing functions (wouldn't get full HELM API)
	- can use bravado to make rest calls 
	- set up code might be tougher, have to create the rudder endpoint
-Helm 
	-cli, so we need a cli wrapper to allow Helm commands
	-logistics of setting it up seem a little simpler
	-in the broker we can add a method for this 
	-add it to container-service-extension restApi with cli wrapper
	-need to install helm, we can fetch their binaries 
	-pretty easy installation, then we can let helm do its thing
	-even we can install for them, with a script
	-helm.sh

or we can use helm commands packaged inside of vcd/cse
